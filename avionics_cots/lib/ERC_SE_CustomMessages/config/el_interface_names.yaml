    # Pedro here:

    # Just some comments about the topics:
      # There are a lot of topics that are not being used but are still implemented in the code.
      # The ones that are not used are commented out in the general list.
      # There are a lot of topics that are for calibration and configuration.

    # I have created some selection for the CS to implement:
      # the esential ones implemented in Poland 2024. 
      # I have left the ones used but not sure it works as I can't find the parameter reference on the Broco code:
      # p.ex: "elec_voltmeter_pubsub"

    # Parameter not found:

    # elec_voltmeter_pubsub: /EL/voltage 
    # elec_container_mass: /EL/container/mass
    # elec_fourinone_sensor: /EL/four_in_one
    # elec_drill_mass: /El/drill/mass
    # elec_imu_pubsub: /EL/Imu

    # These are the important for CS with the references found in Broco:
